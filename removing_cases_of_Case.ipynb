    "I have been told that *Neuromancer* by William Gibson is one of the best and most foundational science fiction books there is. I've wanted to read it for awhile, but now that I've started, I find myself unable to get through it. Part of it is Gibson's depiction of female characters, but I've trudged through misogynistic novels before. No. My main problem is this: in dialogue, characters *constantly* address other characters by their names when they talk to them. And by constantly I mean almost every other sentence. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"Get your coffee, __Case__,\" Molly said. \"You’re okay, but you’re not going anywhere 'til Armitage has his \n",
    "say.\" She sat cross legged on a silk futon and began to fieldstrip the fletcher without bothering to look at \n",
    "it. Twin mirrors tracking as he crossed to the table and refilled his cup. <br><p></p>\n",
    "\"Too young to remember the war, aren’t you, __Case__?\" Armitage ran a large hand back through his \n",
    "cropped brown hair. A heavy gold bracelet flashed on his wrist. \"Leningrad, Kiev, Siberia. We invented \n",
    "you in Siberia, __Case__.\" <br><p></p>\n",
    "\"What’s that supposed to mean?\" <br><p></p>\n",
    "\"Screaming Fist, __Case__. You’ve heard the name.\" <br><p></p>\n",
    "\"Some kind of run, wasn’t it? Tried to burn this Russian nexus with virus programs. Yeah, I heard about \n",
    "it. And nobody got out.\" <br><p></p>\n",
    "He sensed abrupt tension. Armitage walked to the window and looked out over Tokyo Bay. \"That isn’t \n",
    "true. One unit made it back to Helsinki, __Case__.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "PEOPLE. DON'T. TALK. LIKE. THIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in order for me to get through this book, I am simply going to take out all the cases of Case that don't need to be there. This will be a task of importing messy data, parsing through it to take out all viable Cases, and exporting it to a readable format. "
